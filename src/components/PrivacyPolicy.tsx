      <br />

      <br />

      <h2>How We Protect Your Information</h2>
      <p>We take the security of your personal information seriously and implement a variety of measures to protect it. These include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Data Encryption:</b> Sensitive data is encrypted during transmission using industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology to protect your information as it is transferred to and from our website.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Access Controls:</b> Access to personal information is restricted to authorized personnel who need it to perform their duties. We ensure that our team members are trained on the importance of privacy and data protection.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Regular Security Audits:</b> We conduct regular reviews of our systems to identify potential vulnerabilities and enhance security measures.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Secure Storage:</b> Information collected is stored on secure servers, and we use industry-standard practices to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Password Protection:</b> If user accounts are utilized, we encourage strong password practices and provide tools to help you maintain account security.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We therefore cannot guarantee its absolute security, but we are committed to continuously improving our practices.</p>
      <br />
